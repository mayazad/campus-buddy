    <!-- Social Footer from menu.php legacy? No, menu.php had social footer. Let's include it here or in menu. -->
    <!-- legacy/includes/menu.php had social footer at the end. -->
    <!-- I see social-footer in menu.php content above. I should move it to menu or footer. -->
    <!-- The legacy Dashboard1/index.php included menu at top and footer at bottom. -->
    <!-- The social-footer was in menu.php but structurally likely at bottom of sidebar? -->
    <!-- In menu.php, it was after sidebar. -->
    <!-- I should include it in menu.blade.php or footer.blade.php if it's meant to be global. -->
    <!-- Let's check menu.php again. It was at the end. I missed it in my create menu.blade.php call above? -->
    <!-- Yes, I missed the social-footer part in menu.blade.php content. -->
    <!-- I will add it to menu.blade.php in a subsequent edit or if I can edit previous tool call (I can't). -->
    <!-- I'll add it to footer.blade.php for now, or append to menu.blade.php. -->
    <!-- It seems it was part of the sidebar navigation area visually. -->
